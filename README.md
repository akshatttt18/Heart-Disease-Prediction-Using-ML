# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project using logistic regression to predict the presence of heart disease based on clinical data.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project applies **Logistic Regression**, a supervised learning algorithm, to classify whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on several health parameters.

The dataset is preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and evaluated using accuracy score and a confusion matrix.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- The dataset used is stored as `data.csv` and contains multiple features such as:
  - `age`, `sex`, `cp` (chest pain type), `trestbps` (resting blood pressure), etc.
  - The `target` column indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.
